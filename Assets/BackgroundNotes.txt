Scale for backgrounds is 1.85, then set position to 0, 0, 5 for perfect set with camera

Horizontal length of backgrounds, when scaled to 1.85, will be 35.5

When organizing background bits into GameObjects, remember to set parent GameObject's transform.Position values to 0, 0, 0 unless you're trying to do something specific


Parallaxing effect script is already in the Scripts folder:
As a general rule of thumb, when setting background speeds, every subsequent layer's speed should be halved to achieve the parallaxing event

i.e.
Front Layer 20
Middle Layer 10
Back Layer 5

Don't forget to rename stuff to appropriate values
